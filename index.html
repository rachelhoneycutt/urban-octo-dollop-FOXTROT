            <p>Hello, I am a Senior at the Univeristy of North Alabama studying Computer Science. I chose Computer Science
                because I love problem solving which you do a lot of when coding. My favorite thing
                to do outdside of school work is to hang out with friends. UNA's Baptist Campus Minsitries (BCM) lets
                me meet great people and hang out with them. I love serving on the production team at the BCM and attending
                all the events One of my favourite things to do with my friends is to play games. We are obsessed
                with all types of board games and puzzles. Outside of UNA I love to volunteer with my local church,
                Woodmont Baptist Church. At this church I attend the college group on Wednesday nights
                when I am in school. Through doing this I have had the opportunity of being the college student 
                on the college committee at the church. This means I attend meetings with the other members of the 
                committee and represent the church on UNA's campus. I also like to help with the food pantry at my 
                church back home, Cornerstone Baptist Church. They have a food pantry once a month where we hand 
                out boxes of food to people who stop by. Before the day when the food is given out the church has a 
                time when people come and help pack the boxes. I also love to volunteer with Amelia's Closet 
                out of Huntsville. This is a nonprofit organization that helps mothers in need by providing them with 
                diapers. They hold different events where people come and help them pack diapers and label them
                before they are distributed. Some of my favorite artists are the Jonas Brother, Lewis Capaldi, Taylor Swift,
                Olivia Rodrigo, and Lauren Daigle. Some of my favorite TV shows are The Vampire Diaries, Nancy Drew,
                Virgin River, The Rookie, Grey's Anatomy, and Sweet Magonolia's.
